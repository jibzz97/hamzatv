Blog Search + Categories Patch

What this adds:
- Admin (/admin): "Categories/Tags" input (comma-separated). Saved with each post.
- Blog page (blog.html): search bar + tag cloud. Click a tag to filter. Instant search in titles & excerpts.
- Blog list items show tags as badges; clicking a badge filters by that tag.
- Static export (admin button) includes tags in SEO (keywords, articleSection) and in-page tag list.

How to install:
1) Download this zip and merge into your site root.
   - Replace admin/index.html, js/cms.js, js/blog.js.
   - Replace blog.html (it adds the search field and tag cloud container).
   - Append css/styles.css with the provided CSS (or drop-in if you keep styles in one file).
2) Open /admin/, write a post, set Tags (e.g., "Movies, IPTV"), Publish.
3) Visit /blog.html to test search and tag filters.
